## Command cheatsheet
## Basic commands for Bash (Unix) shell and Git

---

### Bash: navigating the file system

**`pwd`** print working directory

**`ls`** list directory

- `ls -l`: list a lot of file information
- `ls -lh`: list a lot of human-readable file information

**`cd`** change directory

---

### Bash: interacting with files and directories

**`mkdir`** make directory

**`cat`** send file or files to output (in most cases, this shows the content of a file without having to open it)

**`head`** output first parts of a file or files (default is usually 10 lines)

**`tail`** output last parts of a file or files (default is usually 10 lines)

**`mv`** rename or move a file or files. Syntax for renaming a file: `mv FILENAME NEWFILENAME`  **USE WITH CAUTION!!!**

**`cp`** copy a file or files. Syntax: `cp FILENAME NEWFILENAME`

**`rm`** remove a file or files. **USE WITH CAUTION!!!**

---

### Bash: getting information about file contents

**`wc`** counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files

- `wc -l`: counts only the number of lines
- `wc -w`: counts only the number of words
- `wc -c`: counts only the number of characters

**`sort`** sends an alphabetically sorted list of the contents of a file to output (usually to the screen). Does not change the file itself.

- `sort -n`: sorts the output numerically
- `sort -r`: reverses the order of the sort, e.g.: Z-A or 10-01

---

### Bash: pipes and filters

**`*`** wildcard character that matches 0 or more characters

**`?`** wildcard character that matches exactly one character

**`>`** redirect output to a new location. Syntax with `cat`: `cat FILENAME1 FILENAME2 > NEWFILENAME`  **USE WITH CAUTION!!!**

**`>>`** append output to an existing location. Syntax with `cat`: `cat FILENAME1 FILENAME2 >> FILENAME3`

**`|`** called a pipe. Takes the output of one command and sends it to another command. Syntax with `wc`, `sort`, and `head`: `wc -l FILENAMES | sort -n | head -n 1`

---

### Bash: syntax of a for loop

	for filename in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
	do
	head -n 3 $filename
	done

Context of this for loop:
- "filename" is the variable named in the first line and called ("$filename") in the third line of the loop
- The loop is operating on the two files named in the first line, basilisk.dat and unicorn.dat
- The third line shows what is being done to the two files; in this case, showing the first three lines of each file.	

---

### Basic Git commands 

**`git init`**: creates a git repository

**`git status`** : view the status of your files in the working directory and staging area

**`git add`**: tells git to start tracking a file, or a series of files. 

**`git commit`**: commits (saves) the staged snapshot to the project history. 

**`git log`**: shows all the commits in the project history

**`git diff`**: shows changes made to files

**`git remote add origin`**: add a remote repository where changes will be stored, usually for collaboration

**`git push`**: sends local changes to a remote repository

**`git pull`**: brings changes made in a remote repository to the local repository
